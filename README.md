Small and 8-bit retro styled game that originated to be a gift for friend of mine for his 30ties. The implementation is done with Box2D implementation called box2dweb physics engine and HTML5 - canvas using is IvanK as graphics engine. The physics engine is quite much on background, but basically you could just leave the bullets to stack up.
